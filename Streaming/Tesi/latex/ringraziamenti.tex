\chapter*{Acknowledgements 2.0}

Students often think that this is the moment in which they will permanently close the books, I must, fortunately, admit that it's not so, at least for us computer scientists, that we live in a world where information technology is constantly evolving and we must always keep ourselves updated to not become dinosaurs.\\
